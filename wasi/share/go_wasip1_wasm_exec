# go_wasip1_wasm_exec is a script that Go uses to run WASM modules
# compiled with GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm.
#
# From `go help run`:
#
#   If [...] GOOS or GOARCH is different from the system default, and a
#   program named go_$GOOS_$GOARCH_exec can be found on the current search
#   path, 'go run' invokes the binary using that program. This allows
#   execution of cross-compiled programs when a simulator or other execution
#   method is available.
#
# To use the script, first ensure wasirun is installed and available in $PATH:
#
#   $ go install github.com/malivvan/zero/wasi/cmd/wasirun@latest
#
# Then, add the directory this script resides in to your $PATH:
#
#   $ export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/stealthrocket/wasi-go/share"
#
# This will grant you the ability to run WASM modules using wasirun:
#
#   $ GOOS-wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go run ...
#
# Note that there is a similar script in the Go source repository under
# ./misc/wasm, but it only supports the wasmtime and wazero runtimes (and
# their WASI host modules) at this time.

exec wasirun --dir / --env PWD="$PWD" ${GOWASIRUNTIMEARGS:-} "$1" -- "${@:2}"
